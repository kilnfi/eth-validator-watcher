    """Process validator attestation duties for the current slot.

    The current slot contains attestations from the previous slot (and
    potentially older ones).  A validator is considered to have
    performed its duties if in the current slot it attested for the
    previous slot.

    The format is a bit tricky to get right here: attestations are
    aggregated per committees and each committee handles a subset of
    validators, there are 64 committees.

    Each attestation is composed of two bitfields:

    - committee_bits: 64 entries are present, if set to 1 there are
      attestations for validators inside this committee,
    - aggregation_bits: length of this bitfield is the SUM(len) of
      validators in active committees.

    This works well because there is usually way less "attestation
    flavors" on a specific flow, most of the network will vote for the
    same thing under normal condition, so there is usually one entry
    with most committee bits sets and aggregation bits. There may be
    4-5 different flavors, but most of the time this is less than the
    64 committees so this format is efficient.

    This is defined in the consensus specs as follows:

    ```
    def get_attesting_indices(state: BeaconState, attestation: Attestation) -> Set[ValidatorIndex]:
        output: Set[ValidatorIndex] = set()
